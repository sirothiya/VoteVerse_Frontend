#VoteVerse — Full-Stack Voting Platform with Explainable AI Insights

Built a production-grade, role-based voting platform supporting Admin, Candidate, and Voter workflows, with secure authentication and real-time data handling.

Designed and implemented an explainable AI pipeline to analyze candidate content, combining machine-learning–based sentiment analysis with confidence estimation and rule-based trust scoring.

Engineered the system end-to-end: data ingestion, feature processing, AI inference, persistence, and visualization—ensuring AI outputs are transparent, interpretable, and actionable for users rather than opaque predictions.

Focused on real-world AI concerns such as uncertainty, bias signals, and reliability, bridging traditional software engineering with applied machine learning.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
